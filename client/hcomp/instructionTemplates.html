    Now let's practice the interface with a warm-up task. For the next 2 minutes, try to think of as many uses as you can for a brick. Do not merely list other things associated with bricks (e.g., house, construction hat), but rather things you could use a brick for (e.g., building material, doorstop, anchor, etc.). When you are ready, click "Got it".

    That's it! Please stay tuned, the brainstorm will begin momentarily. In the meantime, feel free to play around with the interface. Try to generate more alternative uses for a brick and see how many you can get!
