<template name="TutorialWelcome">
    Welcome! Before we start the HIT, we will take you through a short step-by-step tutorial to familiarize you with the interface.
</template>

<template name="TutorialGeneralInfo">
    Your task is to generate as many creative ideas as you can for a brainstorming problem for 10 minutes. Time remaining for the task is displayed here. <strong>DO NOT</strong> refresh your browser during the HIT: you'll be kicked out of the system and won't be able to complete the HIT.
</template>

<template name="TutorialExitEarly">
    If at any time you do not wish to continue, you may exit the study by clicking on this button. Your compensation will be pro-rated based on how long you participated.
</template>

<template name="TutorialProblem">
    The brainstorming problem will be shown here.
</template>

<template name="TutorialIdeaEntry">
    You will enter your ideas here. Submit ideas by pressing enter or clicking on the "Submit Idea" button.
</template>

<template name="TutorialIdeaTry">
    Let's practice the interface with a warm-up task! For the next 2 minutes, try to think of as many uses as you can for a brick (e.g., building material, doorstop). Feel free to get creative, but don't just list other things associated with bricks (e.g., house, construction hat). When you are ready, click "Got it".
</template>

<template name="TutorialInstructions">
    All of the instructions from this tutorial will be summarized in this section. It will be available throughout the task: just click "show/hide" to show or hide the instructions. 
</template>

<template name="TutorialWait">
    That's it! Please stay tuned, the brainstorm should begin in 2-3 minutes. In the meantime, feel free to play around with the interface. Try to generate more alternative uses for a brick and see how many you can get!
</template>

<template name="TutorialTreatInsp">
    If you run out of ideas or want some fresh inspiration AND the button is green, press the button to get a question or idea that is meant to stimulate your thinking.
</template>

<template name="TutorialTreatInspTry">
    This is an "inspiration card". It will contain a question or idea that is meant to stimulate your thinking. If the inspiration sparks any new ideas, we would like you to enter them directly into this box (ideas unrelated to any inspiration can go in the main idea entry box). Let's give it a try! Enter something into the text field and either press enter or the “Submit Idea” button.
</template>

<template name="TutorialTreatInspMany">
    You can ask for more inspirations at any time. Newer inspirations will come in on the left. If you have more inspiration cards than the screen will fit, you may have to scroll right to see older ones.
</template>

<template name="InstructionsGeneral">
    Your task is to generate as many creative ideas as you can for the brainstorming problem for 10 minutes. When the time is up, you will complete a brief survey, and be taken to a page where you can submit the HIT.
