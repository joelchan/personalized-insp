          <h2>Alternative Uses Task</h2>
          <p>Please brainstorm as many uses as you can for a common object. Please do not merely list other things that come to mind when you think about the object the goal is to come up with as many uses of an object as possible. For example, if the object is a "cup", do NOT simply list words like "water", "handle", and "coffee", but DO list uses like "musical instrument", "hold water", "pencil holder". You'll be doing this for 5 mins each for 2 objects. Our system will keep time and move you through the objects and take you to the next page automatically. Right now, <u>please brainstorm as many uses as you can for a <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:16px;">{{fluencyObject}}</span></u>.</p>
          <p><u><strong>Please enter each idea as a separate submission by pressing the "Enter" button or clicking on "Submit idea" after each idea</strong></u>.</p>
