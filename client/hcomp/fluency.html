          <h2>Warm-up</h2>
          <p>Please <u>brainstorm as many uses as you can for a <b>{{fluencyObject}}</b></u>. Please do not merely list other things that come to mind when you think about the object (e.g., “house, construction hats, etc."); the goal is to come up with as many uses of an object as possible (e.g., “building material, doorstop, anchor, etc.”). You'll be doing this for 5 mins each for 2 objects (including this one). Our system will keep time and move you through the objects and take you to the next page automatically. Good luck!</p>
          <p><u><strong>Please enter each idea as a separate submission by pressing the "Enter" button or clicking on "Submit idea" after each idea</strong></u>.</p>
