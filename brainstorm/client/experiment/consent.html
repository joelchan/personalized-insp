<h2>Participant Consent</h2>

<p>This design strategy study is part of a research study conducted by
Christopher MacLellan, Steven Dow, Ken Koedinger, and Steven Dang 
at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of different ideation
strategies on design outcomes.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>During this study, you will be asked complete a series of user interface
design tasks. These tasks consist of coming up with ideas for various cell-phone
applications and building low-fidelity prototypes to represent these ideas. If
at any time you become frustrated or no longer want to participate, you may
exit the session, and your compensation will be pro-rated according to your progress
in the study.</p>

<p>We plan to keep your identity private, and separate from the information we
collect. Your name will be replaced by a code name in all publications and
presentations that are released to the public.</p>

<h2>Expected Duration and Location</h2>

<p>Your participation will involve a single 1-hour session. This experiment will take
place online.</p>

<h2>Participant Requirements</h2>

<p>Participants must be over 18 years old.</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no
greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.</p>

<h2>Rights</h2>

<p>Your decision to participate in this study is voluntary.  You are free to
stop participation at any point.  Refusal to participate, withdrawal of your
consent or discontinued participation in the study will not result in any
penalty or loss of benefits or rights to which you might otherwise be entitled.
The Principal Investigator may at his/her discretion remove you from the study
for any of a number of reasons.  In such an event, you will not suffer any
penalty or loss of benefits or rights to which you might otherwise be
entitled.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>You may receive benefits from participation in the study, such as learning
more about design principles. Additionally, the knowledge gained in this study
may help improve methods of design education.</p>

<h2>Compensation &amp; Costs</h2>
<p>We are providing $10 gift cards as compensation. There is no 
additional cost to you for participating in this study.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>By participating in the study, you understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon
may be required to disclose this consent form, data and other personally
identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or court
order.  Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in the following
