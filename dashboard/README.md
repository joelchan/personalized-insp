This folder contains 3 vizualizations. They are constructed using d3.js.

In order to run the vizualizations d3.js must be present. all the vizs read in data from the flare.csv file.
more columns of data can be added to the csv file if needed.
each row in the csv file is for a different "idea"
column headings are as follows:

idea_label - the label of the idea
parent_label - name of the parent of the current idea
size - the size of the node (this is used for certain vizs. this can be changed to different data that is necessary)
strength - the strength of the link between parent and child between 0-9.

1. circle packing
